# Welder_Power_Supply
This welding powersupply was completed for a course where my group and I designed, soldered, built and coded a welder powersupply to provide a constant voltage over a weld using an arduino uno. 
This was a collaboration project where we tested it on a functional model where the powersupply was removed and ours was installed. 
We obtained good results and good grade.
